/**
 * Catches any exception thrown from an `@GatewayRoute`-decorated handler and
 * serializes it into an `IGatewayReply` envelope with the appropriate HTTP
 * status.
 * @remarks
 * **Locally attached** via `@UseFilters(GatewayExceptionFilter)` inside the
 * `@GatewayRoute` decorator — never registered globally. Because it is bound
 * only to gateway-exposed handlers, every invocation of this filter is
 * guaranteed to originate from one, so there is no need to discriminate
 * between gateway and non-gateway exception origins at catch time.
 *
 * Policy is delegated to injected contracts:
 *   - `IErrorBodyFactory` via `GATEWAY_ERROR_BODY_FACTORY` — extracts
 *     a `(status, body)` pair from an arbitrary throw. The default
 *     implementation recognizes Nest `HttpException` via `instanceof`
 *     and falls through to `500` for anything else.
 *   - `IGatewayReplyBuilder` via `GATEWAY_REPLY_BUILDER` — assembles
 *     the outbound envelope.
 *
 * Pipe and guard exceptions are also caught here: NestJS runs exception
 * filters after pipes/guards throw, so validation errors (e.g., from
 * typia pipes) are correctly serialized into structured HTTP responses
 * rather than surfacing as raw 500s on the client side.
 *
 * Logging policy is intentionally symmetric with `@zerly/errors`
 * `AllExceptionsFilter`: exceptions whose resolved status is `>= 500`
 * are logged at `error` level with request context (pattern, matched
 * path, request id, remote addr); anything `< 500` is treated as an
 * expected client-facing signal and emitted silently. The global
 * `AllExceptionsFilter` never sees gateway exceptions because this
 * filter is attached locally via `@UseFilters` from the `@GatewayRoute`
 * decorator — duplicating the policy here keeps operators from losing
 * sight of handler crashes that would otherwise disappear into a bare
 * 500 response with no trace.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Attached automatically by @GatewayRoute — consumers never reference this
 * // class directly. Throw any Nest HttpException inside a handler and the
 * // filter produces the matching envelope with status + getResponse() body.
 * @GatewayRoute({ pattern: 'users.get', method: 'GET', path: '/users/:id' })
 * getUser(@GatewayParam('id') id: string) {
 *   const user = this.users.findById(id);
 *   if (!user) {
 *     throw new NotFoundException('User not found');
 *   }
 *   return user;
 * }
 * ```

   * Wrapping the envelope in `of(...)` makes Nest treat it as a

   * error serializer rather than relying on JSON's default `Error`

   *
   * The request envelope is nullable in practice — callers that synthesise
   * a test `ArgumentsHost` may not populate `switchToRpc().getData()` — so
   * every field is read defensively. A missing request produces a log
   * entry with only the error, which is still more useful than silence.
