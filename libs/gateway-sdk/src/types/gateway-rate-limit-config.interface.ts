 *   the configured rate. Appropriate for single-instance
 *   deployments or hot-path routes (health checks) where
 *   network-store latency is unacceptable.
 *
 * - `'nats-kv'`: distributed GCRA state in a NATS JetStream KV
 *   bucket. All gateway replicas share counters → correct rate
 *   enforcement regardless of replica count. Reuses the existing
 *   NATS cluster (zero extra infrastructure). Documented ceiling:
 *   ~5k req/s across all rate-limited routes.
 *
 * - `'redis'`: **declared in the SDK contract; not yet implemented
 *   in the Go gateway.** Using `'redis'` today logs a warning on
 *   startup and falls back to `'memory'` for the affected route.
 *   Full Redis support is a planned future addition.
 * @remarks Store selection is applied per-route. A gateway process
 * can serve `'memory'`-backed and `'nats-kv'`-backed routes
 * simultaneously — each route's `store` field independently
 * selects its backend.
