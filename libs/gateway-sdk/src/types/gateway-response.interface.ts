 * Mutable response-side builder injected into `@GatewayRoute`
 * and `@GatewayAuthVerifier` handlers via `@GatewayResponse()`.
 * @remarks
 * Methods return `this` for chainable DX (`res.status(201).cookie(...).header(...)`).
 * The builder is backed by a pooled accumulator so repeated
 * request-cycle creation is effectively allocation-free at
 * steady state.
 *
 * **Express-convention throw semantics.** When a handler throws
 * after calling any of these methods, the accumulator state is
 * **entirely discarded** — status, headers, and cookies. The
 * `GatewayExceptionFilter` builds its reply envelope purely from
 * the thrown exception and never reads the accumulator. Handlers
 * that need headers on an error path must throw an `HttpException`
 * whose response object carries a `headers` field. See design
 * spec §9.2 for the full contract.
