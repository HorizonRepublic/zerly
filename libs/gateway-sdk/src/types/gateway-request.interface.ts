/**
 * Envelope payload sent by `zerly-gateway-server` to a Nest handler over
 * Core NATS request/reply.
 * @template TBody - Type of the parsed HTTP body. Defaults to `unknown` for
 *                   safety; narrow via the handler signature or param decorators.
 * @template TAuth - Type of the verifier claims injected by the gateway for
 *                   protected routes. Defaults to `unknown`; narrow via
 *                   `@GatewayUser()` parameter typing or an explicit generic
 *                   argument on the envelope itself.
 * @remarks
 * Application code typically does not touch this type directly — param
 * decorators (`@GatewayBody`, `@GatewayParam`, `@GatewayUser`, etc.) extract
 * the fields individually. Use `@Payload()` with this type when you need
 * the raw envelope.
