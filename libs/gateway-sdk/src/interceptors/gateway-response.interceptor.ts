 * from under downstream transport code synchronously before
 * the envelope reaches the gateway.
 *

/**
 * Wraps the return value of an `@GatewayRoute`-decorated handler into an
 * `IGatewayReply` envelope, applying configured status-resolution rules.
 * @remarks
 * **Locally attached** via `@UseInterceptors(GatewayResponseInterceptor)`
 * inside the `@GatewayRoute` decorator — never registered globally. Because
 * it is bound only to gateway-exposed handlers, the interceptor never has
 * to discriminate between gateway and non-gateway calls: its mere presence
 * on the execution stack is proof of the former.
 *
 * HTTP metadata is read from `PATTERN_EXTRAS_METADATA` — the same NestJS
 * reflection key that `@MessagePattern(pattern, { meta: { http } })`
 * writes to. No custom reflection key is introduced, so HTTP routing
 * metadata has a single source of truth per handler.
 *
 * All normalization policy is delegated to injected contracts:
 *   - `IGatewayReplyBuilder` via `GATEWAY_REPLY_BUILDER`
 *   - `IStatusResolver` via `GATEWAY_STATUS_RESOLVER`
 *
 * **Response mutation integration.** Handlers that inject
 * `@GatewayResponse()` mutate a pooled `GatewayResponseAccumulator`
 * stashed on the envelope under a module-private `Symbol` key.
 * During `map()` this interceptor reads the accumulator and
 * merges its `statusCode` / `headers` into the outgoing reply —
 * `statusCode` wins over `IStatusResolver` when set, and
 * `headers` is forwarded verbatim to `replyBuilder.success`.
 * A `finalize` operator releases the accumulator back to the
 * pool on both success and error paths so throw/complete are
 * symmetric from the pool's perspective (the Express-convention
 * throw semantics then let the exception filter ignore the
 * accumulated STATE while the pool still reclaims the OBJECT).
 *
 * **Zero-overhead fast path.** Handlers that do NOT inject
 * `@GatewayResponse()` pay a single `envelope[SYMBOL] === undefined`
 * check (hidden-class lookup, ~2-3ns) and fall through to the
 * pre-mutation behavior with no allocation, no pool touch, and
 * the `finalize` callback short-circuits.
 *
 * The defensive `meta.http` guard covers the unsupported edge case in
 * which a consumer manually attaches this interceptor to a non-gateway
 * handler; rather than throwing at runtime, the interceptor passes the
 * handler output through untouched.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * @GatewayRoute({ pattern: 'users.create', method: 'POST', path: '/users' })
 * createUser(@GatewayBody() dto: CreateUserDto) {
 *   return this.usersService.create(dto);
 * }
 * ```
