/**
 * Module-private `Symbol` used to stash the per-request response
 * accumulator on the NestJS RPC envelope.
 * @remarks
 * Stored under a `Symbol` key (not a string) so the slot stays
 * invisible to user-land TypeScript types — the envelope still
 * looks like a plain `IGatewayRequest` to handler code while
 * the interceptor and the `@GatewayResponse()` decorator share
 * a reliable mutation target at runtime.
 *
 * Exported ONLY to the two collaborators that need it — the
 * `GatewayResponse` parameter decorator and the
 * `GatewayResponseInterceptor`. Do NOT re-export it from the
 * package barrel: user code must go through `@GatewayResponse()`
 * to touch the accumulator.
 *
 * Performance notes:
 *
 *   - Module-level constant: one allocation at SDK load,
 *     zero per-request cost.
 *   - `Symbol` property access on an object is a direct
 *     hidden-class lookup in V8 (~2-3ns), strictly cheaper
 *     than `WeakMap.get` (~50-100ns) or
 *     `AsyncLocalStorage.getStore()` (~20-50ns with async
 *     chain overhead).
