/**
 * Contract for constructing `IGatewayReply` envelopes for both success and
 * error paths.
 * @remarks
 * **Single source of truth for reply envelope shape.** All wire-level reply
 * construction MUST go through an `IGatewayReplyBuilder` implementation —
 * neither the response interceptor nor the exception filter is allowed to
 * build envelopes inline. Centralizing envelope assembly behind one seam
 * keeps `status`, `headers`, and `body` ordering consistent across code
 * paths and leaves a single file to audit when the wire format evolves.
 *
 * The default implementation (`DefaultGatewayReplyBuilder`) produces
 * JSON envelopes with an empty headers map. Future implementations
 * may add Content-Type negotiation, alternative wire formats (CBOR,
 * MessagePack), or domain-specific reply enrichment (correlation headers,
 * cache hints) — all swappable via DI by binding a custom class to the
 * `GATEWAY_REPLY_BUILDER` token from `../../tokens/gateway-tokens.constant`.
 *
 * Keeping this surface as an interface rather than an abstract class means
 * consumers can adapt existing helper objects without inheritance
 * gymnastics, and the SDK stays framework-agnostic at the type level.

   * @param body - Handler return value, or `null` for void/204 responses.
   *               Implementations must not mutate or deep-clone the value;
