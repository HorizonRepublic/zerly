/**
 * Contract for resolving the HTTP status code of a successful handler return.
 * @remarks
 * The default implementation (`DefaultStatusResolver`) applies the
 * standard rules, in precedence order:
 *
 *   1. Explicit `statusCode` from `@ApiGateway` options
 *      (`IGatewayHttpMeta.statusCode`).
 *   2. `DEFAULT_STATUS_NO_CONTENT` (204) for `null` / `undefined` returns.
 *   3. `DEFAULT_STATUS_OK` (200) otherwise.
 *
 * Custom implementations may layer domain-specific rules on top — for
 * example "all handlers whose pattern ends in `.create` default to 201",
 * or "handlers tagged with a custom metadata marker default to 202".
 * Override by binding a custom class to the `GATEWAY_STATUS_RESOLVER`
 * token from `../../tokens/gateway-tokens.constant`.
 *
 * This contract is deliberately *one method only*: single responsibility
 * means easier testing, simpler substitution, and no temptation to leak
 * unrelated concerns (body shaping, error handling, logging, header
 * injection) into the resolver. Anything that is not "pick a status code"
 * belongs in a different seam.
