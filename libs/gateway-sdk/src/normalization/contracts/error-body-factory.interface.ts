/**
 * Contract for translating an arbitrary thrown value into an HTTP
 * status code and a wire-ready response body.
 * @remarks
 * The SDK takes no position on what an error body should look like —
 * this contract is the single seam where applications decide. The
 * default implementation (`DefaultErrorBodyFactory`) matches NestJS's
 * built-in `BaseExceptionFilter` output byte-for-byte so the gateway
 * is transparent: for any `HttpException` subclass it forwards
 * `getStatus()` + `getResponse()`, and for anything else it emits the
 * same generic `{ statusCode: 500, message: 'Internal server error' }`
 * shape Nest uses for unrecognised throws.
 *
 * Applications that need a richer error format (correlation fields,
 * RFC 7807 problem+json, i18n codes, domain-specific metadata) provide
 * their own `IErrorBodyFactory` implementation and bind it against the
 * `GATEWAY_ERROR_BODY_FACTORY` token. The factory returns whatever
 * body shape the project's HTTP contract requires — the gateway
 * transports the result verbatim.
 *
 * Implementations should be stateless. DI-injectable state (logger,
 * config, metrics) is acceptable, but per-request state is not — the
 * same factory instance is reused for every error across every
 * goroutine.

export interface IErrorBodyFactory {
  /**
   * Translate a thrown value into a `{ status, body }` pair.
   * @param error - The value thrown by the handler. Typed as `unknown`
   *                because JavaScript allows any value to be thrown —
   *                strings, numbers, plain objects, or `null` — and the
   *                factory is the single layer responsible for deciding
   *                which of those become user-facing HTTP responses.
   * @param request - The inbound request envelope. Ignored by the
   *                  default factory but available for implementations
   *                  that want to weave request-specific context into
   *                  the error body (user-agent-aware formatting, trace
   *                  id propagation, locale-aware messages, etc.).
