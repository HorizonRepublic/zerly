 * Result of translating a thrown value into a gateway error payload.
 * @remarks
 * Separated into a named interface rather than an anonymous
 * `{ status, body }` tuple so it can be referenced in documentation,
 * exported as part of the public API, tested in isolation, and mocked
 * cleanly without re-declaring the shape at every call site.
 *
 * Both fields are `readonly` — once an `IErrorBodyFactory` has decided
 * on a status and body, downstream consumers (reply builder, exception
 * filter, diagnostics) must treat the result as an immutable snapshot.
 * Any adjustments require producing a new `IErrorBodyBuildResult`, which
 * keeps the audit trail clear and prevents accidental mutation between
 * the factory and the wire.

   * status in the 100-599 range — the Go gateway's decoder rejects
   * anything outside that window as a malformed reply.

   * `HttpException.getResponse()` verbatim, matching NestJS's built-in
   * `BaseExceptionFilter`; custom factories may use any JSON-
   * serializable shape they prefer. Sensitive fields (stack traces,
   * internal identifiers) must be stripped by the factory before the
   * body reaches this structure — the downstream layers (reply builder,
   * exception filter, HTTP transport) never rewrite the body.
