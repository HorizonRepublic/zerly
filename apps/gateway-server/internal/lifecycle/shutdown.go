// Package lifecycle orchestrates the gateway's graceful shutdown
// sequence.
//
// The gateway holds four long-lived resources that each need to be
// quiesced cleanly when the process receives SIGTERM:
//
//  1. The Hertz HTTP server — must stop accepting new connections,
//     then drain in-flight requests.
//  2. The registry watcher — must stop its internal goroutine so it
//     no longer attempts to replace the store snapshot after we have
//     begun shutting down.
//  3. The NATS connection(s) — Drain waits for in-flight subscriptions
//     and publishes to finish before tearing down the socket, which
//     is what gives the gateway its "no request left behind" guarantee
//     during rolling deployments.
//  4. (Implicit) any per-request goroutines spawned by the Hertz
//     handler — these are owned by Hertz and drained by its own
//     Shutdown call.
//
// The shutdown is strictly ordered: HTTP first (stop the source of
// new work), watcher second (so a late KV delta cannot mutate the
// routing table after we have stopped serving), NATS last (so any
// in-flight upstream replies have a chance to land before we close
// the socket). A global deadline bounds every step so the gateway
// cannot hang forever on a stuck dependency.

//     sentinel via the Router's closed-state machinery instead of a
//     raw "connection draining" error from the underlying NATS-KV
//     store. The handler's FailPolicy then maps the sentinel to a
//     deterministic allow/reject decision.
//   - The NATS connection is still alive while the Router closes its
//     stores, so any close-time RPC the NATS-KV store needs to issue
//     (e.g., final ping or unsubscribe) does not race the connection
//     teardown.

//     immutable; a late KV delta cannot mutate it after we stopped
//     serving.
//  3. Rate-limit router close — turns every Store backend into the

//     off during HTTP shutdown sees ratelimit.ErrStoreClosed instead
//     of a raw "connection draining" error from the NATS-KV store.
