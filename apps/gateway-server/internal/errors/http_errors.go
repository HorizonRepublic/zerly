// Package errors exposes pre-encoded HTTP error response bodies for
// use on the gateway's hot path.
//
// Computing the JSON once at init() time and reusing both the status
// code and the byte slice for every error response eliminates
// allocations on the error path. At gateway scale — where a small
// percentage of every traffic spike returns 404/504/502 — this is
// measurably worth it in benchmarks, and it also guarantees that a
// given error class always ships the same wire shape regardless of
// which goroutine produced it.
//
// Each error is exposed as an HTTPError value rather than a loose
// pair of (int, []byte) variables so handler code passes a single
// symbolic argument and cannot accidentally pair a 404 body with a
// 500 status or vice versa.

// Go has no read-only struct field, so external code COULD reassign
// Status or mutate the Body slice in place — doing so would corrupt
// every subsequent response that reads the same shared instance.
// Callers MUST treat both fields as read-only. The build factory
// produces a fresh slice per HTTPError so the package-level values
// do not alias each other; once init() returns, the slices are
// treated as frozen for the remainder of the process lifetime.
