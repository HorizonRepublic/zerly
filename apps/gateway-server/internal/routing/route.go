// registry.HandlerEntry and consumed by the proxy layer, which uses
// the Subject field to address the downstream NATS RPC and the
// PathTemplate as a cache key for logs and metrics.

// by value inside the linearTable bucket and copied out on each
// successful Lookup, which keeps the hot path allocation-free.

	// time keeps the per-request hot path free of string concatenation
	// and lookups in the registry.

	// raw request path — the template is a bounded-cardinality label,
	// the raw path is not.

// 401 reply instead of short-circuiting. 403 and transport errors
